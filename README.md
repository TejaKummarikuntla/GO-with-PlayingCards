# GO-with-PlayingCards
This program was made to brush my GoLang skills as of Fun

- ```deck.go``` consist of all the functions that makes the play </br >
- ```deck_test.go``` as it's ending with ```_test.go``` it represents the testing process of funcs in ```deck.go``` </br >
- ```my_cards``` is a file generated by the func ```saveToFile``` in ```deck.go```
